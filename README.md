# Productivity Tools

Custom productivity tools that I use day to day. It's likely that you will
have to adapt the code, should you choose to use them in your work.

## `blocked_issues`

**Need**: It's hard to get a quick summary of what issues are blocked in
Zenhub (www.zenhub.com).

**Approach**: `blocked_issues` creates a markdown report of issues that are
blocked.
